# CKEditor 4 Export to PDF Plugin

The **Export to PDF** CKEditor 4 plugin allows you to easily print the WYSIWYG editor content to a PDF file. When enabled, this feature sends the content of your editor together with the styles that are used to display it to the CKEditor Cloud Services HTML to PDF converter service. The service then generates a PDF document that can be downloaded by the user.

Thanks to this plugin, it takes exactly one button click to get a PDF file with content formatted in the same way as the one visible in CKEditor 4.

CKEditor 4 **Export to PDF** also allows various customizations like changing the page size and margin, setting additional styling, adding custom headers and footers and pre-processing content. This gives great flexibility and control over the PDF output and allows to keep all the PDF documents consistent when it comes to styling.

**This feature is in beta version. It is free to use while in the beta phase.**

This is a premium feature. Please [contact us](https://ckeditor.com/contact/) if you would like to purchase a license. Let us know if you have any feedback or questions!

## Getting Started

### Installation from npm

To instal the plugin via npm, simply run:

```bash
npm i ckeditor4-plugin-exportpdf
```

Then add the plugin to your CKEditor 4 instance with the [`addExternal()` method](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_plugins.html#method-addExternal):

```js
CKEDITOR.plugins.addExternal( 'exportpdf', './node_modules/ckeditor4-plugin-exportpdf/' );
```

If you prefer not to link to the `node_modules` folder directly, you may simply copy the entire `./node_modules/ckeditor4-plugin-exportpdf/` directory as `ckeditor/plugins/exportpdf/` and add it with the [`config.extraPlugins`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-extraPlugins) configuration option:

```js
CKEDITOR.replace( 'editor', {
    extraPlugins: 'exportpdf'
} );
```
